# Troubleshooting CLI coding agents

Issues with the coding agents that front the factory — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor CLI, and any other agent that loads the curriculum's skills / slash commands.

## Issue: `/factory-activity-agent` (or another skill) isn't recognized

**Symptom:** Typing `/factory-activity-agent list` in your coding agent's session does nothing, prints "unknown command", or the slash menu doesn't autocomplete the skill.

**Cause:** Usually one of:

- The symlink at `~/.claude/skills/factory-activity-agent` (or your agent's equivalent) didn't resolve — a broken link, wrong target, or the symlink was never created.
- The coding agent hasn't rescanned its skills directory since the symlink was added. Most agents only scan at startup.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm the symlink is valid. For Claude Code:
   ```bash
   ls -l ~/.claude/skills/factory-activity-agent
   ```
   The output should show an arrow (`->`) pointing into the SFI repo, and following the link should land on a real directory. If `ls` reports "No such file or directory" or shows a dangling link, re-create it:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Projects/actual-software/software-factory-intensive
   ln -sfn "$(pwd)/skills/factory-activity-agent" ~/.claude/skills/factory-activity-agent
   ```
   For Codex, use `~/.codex/skills/factory-activity-agent`; for other agents, substitute the correct skills directory.

2. Restart your coding agent so it rescans the skills directory.

3. If the slash command still doesn't show up, copy the directory in instead of symlinking — some agents' skill loaders don't follow symlinks reliably:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.claude/skills/factory-activity-agent
   cp -r skills/factory-activity-agent ~/.claude/skills/factory-activity-agent
   ```
   Restart the agent again.

4. Last resort: run `/factory-activity-agent list` inside a fresh session in the SFI repo. If it works there but not elsewhere, the repo's project-level `.claude/skills/` is resolving and the user-level install genuinely isn't — redo step 1.

## Issue: Coding agent hits a quota / rate-limit error mid-session

**Symptom:** Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI returns a quota / rate-limit / "out of tokens" error, either in an interactive session or inside a running factory agent. Work stalls until the subscription window resets.

**Cause:** The currently-active account has burned through its subscription quota (e.g. a Claude Max five-hour window).

### Recommended fix: switch the CLI to API billing

API (pay-as-you-go) billing is separate from your subscription quota, so a subscription that is rate-limited or exhausted can still keep working by authenticating with an API key from the same provider. This is the fastest unblock for a factory mid-run: you keep the same account, just change how usage is metered.

1. **Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...     # from console.anthropic.com
   ```
   Or, inside the Claude Code session, run `/login` and choose "API key" when prompted. Usage will now bill against your Anthropic Console credits instead of the Max quota. ([docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup#api-key-authentication))
2. **Codex CLI:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...            # from platform.openai.com
   ```
   Or run `codex login` and pick "API key" over the ChatGPT subscription path.
3. **Gemini CLI:**
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=...               # from aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   ```

Restart the coding agent (or `gc restart` for factory agents — see [Troubleshooting Gas City](gas-city.md)) so the new credentials are read at startup. Set the env var in your shell config if you want the switch to persist.

### Alternative: swap to a second account with `aisw`

If you have a second *subscription* account (e.g. a personal and a work Claude Max), [`aisw`](https://burakdede.github.io/aisw/) can fail over to it without touching API keys. `aisw` is a standalone account manager for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI — install via `brew install aisw`, the shell installer, or `cargo install aisw`. It stores named profiles under `~/.aisw/` and swaps a CLI's active credentials on demand. See [Medium - Setting Up Multiple Claude Code Accounts on Your Local Machine](https://medium.com/@buwanekasumanasekara/setting-up-multiple-claude-code-accounts-on-your-local-machine-f8769a36d1b1) for more information.

One-time setup for a second Claude Max account:

1. Log into the first account with `claude` and let it write its credentials. Snapshot them:
   ```bash
   aisw save claude personal
   ```
2. Log out of Claude Code, log into the second account, and snapshot that one too:
   ```bash
   aisw save claude work
   ```
3. Install the shell hook so `aisw use` updates your current shell:
   ```bash
   aisw shell-hook
   source ~/.zshrc                 # or ~/.bashrc / ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```

Fail over during a quota hit:

1. See which account is active and which others are available:
   ```bash
   aisw status
   aisw list
   ```
2. Switch to a profile that still has headroom:
   ```bash
   aisw use claude <profile>      # or: aisw use codex <profile> / aisw use gemini <profile>
   ```
3. Restart the coding agent so it picks up the new credentials — exit and relaunch Claude Code / Codex / Gemini (or `gc restart` for factory agents).

Reach for `aisw` when you prefer subscription-only usage (predictable cost) and already have a spare account; reach for API billing when you don't, or when you only need to unblock for a few minutes.

## Issue: Ran `aisw use` but the CLI still uses the old account

**Symptom:** You ran `aisw use claude <profile>` (or similar), but Claude Code still reports the previous account, still hits the same rate limit, or your quota dashboard shows no change.

**Cause:** One of:

- The aisw shell hook isn't sourced, so the new env vars never landed in your shell.
- The coding agent was already running and cached credentials at startup — a switch doesn't retroactively change a live session.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm the shell hook is loaded:
   ```bash
   echo "$AISW_SHELL_HOOK"
   ```
   If it prints empty, source your shell config (`source ~/.zshrc`, `source ~/.bashrc`, or `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`). Re-install the hook if missing:
   ```bash
   aisw shell-hook
   ```
2. Fully exit the coding agent and relaunch it — a reload / `/clear` inside the same process is not enough. For factory agents, `gc restart` so each agent process is replaced.
3. Re-run `aisw status` from the new shell to confirm the switch stuck before relaunching the CLI.

## Issue: Not sure which account is currently active

**Symptom:** You have multiple profiles configured and want to know which one the next `claude` / `codex` / `gemini` invocation will use.

**Fix:**

```bash
aisw status            # human-readable
aisw status --json     # scriptable — useful in CI or shell prompts
aisw list              # all configured profiles per tool
```

If you want this visible at a glance, add `aisw status` output to your shell prompt — there's a one-liner in the [aisw docs](https://burakdede.github.io/aisw/).

## Issue: `aisw status` shows a coding agent as "not installed" even though it works

**Symptom:** `claude` / `codex` / `gemini` runs fine on your PATH, but `aisw status` reports it as missing and `aisw use <tool> …` refuses to switch profiles.

**Cause:** The binary isn't on `aisw`'s resolved `PATH`, or your shell's command-hash cache is stale.

**Fix:**

1. Confirm the CLI is reachable:
   ```bash
   which claude     # or: which codex / which gemini
   ```
2. Refresh your shell's command cache:
   ```bash
   hash -r          # bash/zsh
   rehash           # zsh (alternative)
   ```
3. Run the built-in diagnostic:
   ```bash
   aisw doctor
   ```
4. If a tool was installed to a non-standard location (e.g. a `~/bin` not in the default `PATH`), add that directory to `PATH` in your shell config before the aisw hook runs, then restart the shell.

## Issue: `aisw use gemini … --state-mode shared` fails

**Symptom:** Switching a Gemini profile with `--state-mode shared` errors out.

**Cause:** Gemini doesn't support configurable shared state mode in `aisw`; the flag is only valid for Claude and Codex.

**Fix:** Drop the `--state-mode` flag when switching Gemini profiles:

```bash
aisw use gemini <profile>
```
